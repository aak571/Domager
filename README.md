An easiest Domain Managing Dashboard with an elegant and professional UI for all your DNS records on AWS Route 53. This app is a middleman between you and Route 53 where you can very easily add, read, edit and delete your Domain and DNS records on to Route 53 through this platform by just two clicks each as directly doing this on AWS console is definitely a tedious task for a common person to understand the jargons of AWS console. You can also add your DNS records for each Domain and also perform add, read, edit and delete operations on them.

Every single API call to AWS Route 53 is made using AWS SDK Version 3 for Nodejs.

â€¢	Technologies used: MERN stack, HTML, CSS, Javascript, AWS SDK V3, Bootstrap.
